# INTRO
For my final capstone project I really wanted to go all out and create an app using an API that could be used by all soccer fans. A user can make an account and be able to see any of the currently listed group stage matches for the upcoming world-cup. Live scores and all! So if you need a way to keep up with your team, this is your app. Groups are placed in a sorted order and they will render the points. You can click into the group and see the stage matches and place your predictions. Be sure to compare yours to the predictions of other users. Thank You!
